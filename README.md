# File Differences

This script analyzes two different files to find the differences between them. The first difference will be reported back with the line number the difference was noted on first, then the index where the difference occured. If both files are identical but one is longer, this will be reported. If both files are identical, this will also be reported.

This repository contains sample files to practice utilizing the script on.
